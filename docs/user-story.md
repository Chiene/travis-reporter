##Travis-reporter user story

1. As an user, I hope I can see the current unsteady test cases directly as soon as I enter Travis-reporter.
2. As an user, I hope I can add, reduce, and define the search criteria by myself to find the test case information I want.
3. As an user, I hope I can examine the Travis jobs of a certain test case within a period after I click on that test case displayed in the Risky table.
4. As an user, I hope I can understand the success/faliure trend of a certain test case easily by a line chart.
